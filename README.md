# ILLiad_Alma_NCIP_Borrowing_Renewals_V2
This is a Server Addon for ILLiad allowing for renewals from ILLiad to Alma via NCIP using a particular ILLiad field as the barcode of an item.  If a field for a barcode is not selected in the configuration, or if the field selected for the barcode is blank, the Addon will send the Transaction Number by default.

This Server Addon needs to be installed in the Customization Manager as a .zip folder. Cnfigurations for the Addon also happen in the Customization Manager.  If you make changes to the configuration in the Customization Manager, and you notice that they are not taking effect, you should restart your System Manager on your ILLiad server.
